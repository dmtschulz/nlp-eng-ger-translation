This project involves developing a machine translation model to automatically translate text between English and German and Vice Versa. The project leverages deep neural networks, which have greatly improved translation performance and accuracy in recent years.

Key Highlights:

- Models / Neural Network Architecture: RNN based sequence to sequence models (encoder-decoder), Attention Mechanism, GloVe, Word2Vec
- Tools: PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
